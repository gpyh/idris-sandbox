== Making functions safer

=== Return a sum type

Return the result wrapped in a `Maybe`, `Either` or a custom `Functor`.
Pattern matching on this allows to handle errors gracefully.

Advantages::
  - Very easy to do
  - A `do` block allows to automatically unwrap the correct values ; the `|`
can be used for error handling

Disadvantages::
  - It all happens at runtime

When to use::
  - When the function is expected to fail
  - When you need to recover the errors in meaningful ways

Examples in the standard library::
  - `Prelude.List.init'`
  - `Prelude.List.tail'`
  - `Data.Vect.exactLength`

=== Require a proof

Create a proof type dependent on some input. Proofs should assert
that the input has the right properties so the function never meets error
cases.

Advantages::
  - All checked at compile time
  - Makes the preconditions apparent in the signature
  - Proofs can hold data that may be reused
  - Can serve as views

Disadvantages::
  - You can't always prove something easily
  - The code is not always clear

When to use::
  - When other exported functions provide the proofs
  - When compile time guarantees are critical

Examples in the standard library::
  - `Data.Vect.Elem`
  - `Data.List.InBounds`

=== Put more data into the type

If the correct inputs can easily be obtained via some data computable at
compile time, you can make your type dependent on that data.

Avantages::
  - Inputs carry the proofs with them
  - Type signatures are clear

Disadvantages::
  - The type will always carry the data, even when you don't care about it
  - In complicated cases, it's possible to simply determine the type of the
output, which would either cause:
    * duplication of code ; you use a second function that will compute the
data in the type, or
    * losing guarantees when calling the function by not limiting the
possible outputs
  - Beware of erasure!

Examples in the standard library::
  - `Data.Vect.index`

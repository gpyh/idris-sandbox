- What is the type theory behind Idris? How does it compare to HoTT?

- A database of proofs: http://us.metamath.org/
Converting those in Idris?
- Can proofs be used by a compiler to optimize code?

- How does Idris lay out things in memory? Is it predictable?
- Haskell's UNPACK?

== Self hosting

- How would the compiler be bootstrapped?
- Which libraries need to be implemented first?
- Can it be partially self-hosted?

Answered at the end of the elaboration paper.

== Misc

- The executor needs some work

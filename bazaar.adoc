- What is the type theory behind Idris? How does it compare to HoTT?

- A database of proofs: http://us.metamath.org/
Converting those in Idris?
- Can proofs be used by a compiler to optimize code?

- How does Idris lay out things in memory? Is it predictable?
- Haskell's UNPACK?

== Jupyter

A Jupyter kernel would fit the _interactive editing_ workflow of Idris.
What's needed to implement one:

- Good Jupyter documentation (duh!)
- A ZeroMQ library, which needs...
- IPv6 in Network.Socket and...
- Bytestrings!

A good plan first would be to revamp the IdrisNet2 library and IPv6 support
in conjunction. After that the ZeroMQ API is trivial.

== Self hosting

- How would the compiler be bootstrapped?
- Which libraries need to be implemented first?
- Can it be partially self-hosted?

Answered at the end of the elaboration paper.

== Misc

- The executor needs some work
